Pros:
ChatGPT code can guide you towards practices/packages that you didn't know existed.
It can provide quick assistance and generate code snippets, saving time in the coding process.
It can correct syntax as well as help with coding conventions and common programming patterns.
For beginners it can serve as a learning aid by explaining concepts, providing examples, and offering guidance.
It can assist in brainstorming ideas, solving coding problems, and generating algorithms.
It can generate code in various programming languages, making it a versatile for different tasks.

Cons:
It sometimes doesn't have a full understanding of the specific requirements, constraints, or context of a project, which leads to misinterpretations.
I doesn't have the ability to execute or debug code, so it can produce bugs in written programs.
The quality of the code generated depends on the clarity and completeness of the input. Ambiguous or incomplete inputs may result in less accurate or relevant responses.
While it helps with specific coding tasks, it is nowhere near a substitute for learning programming fundamentals, problem-solving skills, or gaining hands-on experience.
It may not be aware of the latest programming languages, frameworks, or best practices introduced after it's last learning date.
