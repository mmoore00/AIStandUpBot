"""
Make sure to replace 'YOUR_SLACK_TOKEN' with your actual Slack bot token.

This example uses Flask as a simple web server to handle incoming events from Slack. When the bot is mentioned in a channel, it sends a stand-up message to the user who mentioned the bot.

Remember to set up a Slack app, install it in your workspace, and obtain a bot token to use in the script. Adjust the code as needed based on your specific requirements and environment.
